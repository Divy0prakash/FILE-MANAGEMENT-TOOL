## The objective of this task is to create a C++ application that demonstrates basic file-handling operations. The program should be able to:
Write data to a text file (overwriting existing content).
Append data to a text file (adding new content at the end).
Read data from a text file (displaying the contents back to the user).
The application must use C++ file stream classes (ifstream, ofstream, and fstream) to perform these operations. It should also provide a menu-driven interface, allowing users to choose whether they want to read, write, or append data. The tool should handle errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission issues) and ensure user-friendly interaction.
This project showcases the fundamental techniques of file handling in C++, which are essential for data storage, retrieval, and management in real-world applications.
